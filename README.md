# CAE-Project-Management-Service
This [las2peer](https://github.com/rwth-acis/las2peer) service is used by the [Community Application Editor's](https://github.com/rwth-acis/CAE) frontend for project management.
This includes creating projects and managing their components, users and roles.


## How to build this service
Building the service is just building a las2peer service. The [las2peer template project](https://github.com/rwth-acis/las2peer-Template-Project) and its wiki contain detailed information, but basically you should be able to clone the repository and execute a build using ant.

## How to run using Docker

First build the image:
```bash
docker build . -t cae-project-management-service
```

Then you can run the image like this:

```bash
docker run -e MYSQL_USER=myuser -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=mypasswd -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=personal_access_token -e GITHUB_ORGANIZATION=organization_name -e GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENTID=client_id -e GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENTSECRET=client_secret -p 8080:8080 -p 9011:9011 cae-project-management-service
```

Replace *myuser* and *mypasswd* with the username and password of a MySQL user with access to a database named *commedit*.
By default the database host is *mysql* and the port is *3306*.
You can use --link option to connect the project management service with the MySQL docker container.
Note, when using MYSQL_HOST env variable, it seems to be needed to also give the MYSQL_PORT even if it should be the standard one.
By using the environment variables GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN and GITHUB_ORGANIZATION you can select which GitHub organization gets used for storing the GitHub projects that correspond to CAE projects.
Note, that the user (that the personal access token from GitHub belongs to) must be able to create projects inside the given organization.
You can generate a new personal access token in GitHub under "Settings" -> "Developer settings" -> "Personal access tokens".

For connecting the users CAE account with the GitHub account, an OAuth GitHub app is required. You can read more on how to create a GitHub OAuth app [here](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/creating-an-oauth-app).
Once you've created your OAuth app, you will receive a client id and a client secret. Replace the placeholders *client_id* and *client_secret* in the docker run command with these.
The OAuth app is also used to get access tokens for the GitHub API, which allow to query the GitHub projects API. In order to get access to the GitHub projects, the organization where you host the GitHub projects needs to be configured. In the organization on GitHub, go to Settings, then Third Party access and grant access for your OAuth app. Otherwise access tokens generated by using your OAuth app will not have access to the GitHub projects of your organization.

In order to customize your setup you can set further environment variables.

### Node Launcher Variables

Set [las2peer node launcher options](https://github.com/rwth-acis/las2peer-Template-Project/wiki/L2pNodeLauncher-Commands#at-start-up) with these variables.
The las2peer port is fixed at *9011*.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| BOOTSTRAP | unset | Set the --bootstrap option to bootrap with existing nodes. The container will wait for any bootstrap node to be available before continuing. |
| SERVICE_PASSPHRASE | Passphrase | Set the second argument in *startService('<service@version>', '<SERVICE_PASSPHRASE>')*. |
| SERVICE_EXTRA_ARGS | unset | Set additional launcher arguments. Example: ```--observer``` to enable monitoring. |

The following places should be persisted in volumes in productive scenarios:

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| /src/node-storage | Pastry P2P storage. |
| /src/etc/startup | Service agent key pair and passphrase. |
| /src/log | Log files. |

*Do not forget to persist you database data*
