# CAE-Project-Management-Service
This [las2peer](https://github.com/rwth-acis/las2peer) service is used by the Community Application Editor's frontend for project management.
This includes creating project and managing their users and components.

Please note: The project management service is currently in a very early development phase and not everything will work fine!

## How to build this service
Building the service is just building a las2peer service. The [las2peer template project](https://github.com/rwth-acis/las2peer-Template-Project) and its wiki contain detailed information, but basically you should be able to clone the repository and execute a build using ant.

## How to run using Docker

First build the image:
```bash
docker build . -t cae-project-management-service
```

Then you can run the image like this:

```bash
docker run -e MYSQL_USER=myuser -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=mypasswd -p 8080:8080 -p 9011:9011 cae-project-management-service
```

Replace *myuser* and *mypasswd* with the username and password of a MySQL user with access to a database named *commedit*.
By default the database host is *mysql* and the port is *3306*.
You can use --link option to connect the project management service with the MySQL docker container.
Note, when using MYSQL_HOST env variable, it seems to be needed to also give the MYSQL_PORT even if it should be the standard one.

In order to customize your setup you can set further environment variables.

### Node Launcher Variables

Set [las2peer node launcher options](https://github.com/rwth-acis/las2peer-Template-Project/wiki/L2pNodeLauncher-Commands#at-start-up) with these variables.
